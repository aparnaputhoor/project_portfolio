            <p>The IC Tester is an innovative embedded system project developed to simplify the testing of digital integrated circuits (ICs). As embedded enthusiasts, we designed this tool to support both manual and automatic testing of commonly used logic ICs like 7400, 7402, 7404, etc.

In manual mode, the user can set input conditions using tactile buttons or switches and observe the output on LEDs, making it ideal for learning or quick checks.

In automatic mode, the tester uses a microcontroller (like an Arduino or PIC) to send preprogrammed input combinations and automatically verify outputs based on known truth tables. The results are displayed via LEDs or a display module, making it faster and more reliable for batch testing.

This project not only reduces troubleshooting time for electronics hobbyists and students but also deepened our hands-on experience in digital logic, hardware interfacing, and embedded system design.</p>
